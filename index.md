I am Arpan Jain, a Senior Researcher at Microsoft, contributing to the AI Frameworks (AIFx) team within CoreAI. My work focuses on enhancing the performance and efficiency of deep learning inference, especially for Large Language Models (LLMs). Before this role, I worked as an Applied Scientist at Bing Ads, where I explored deep learning model optimization and novel architectures such as AMD GPUs. I also had the opportunity to present my research at NVIDIA GTC 2024.

I earned my Ph.D. in High Performance Computing and Deep Learning from The Ohio State University, under the guidance of Prof. D. K. Panda. My doctoral research concentrated on developing novel parallelization strategies for large-scale Deep Neural Network (DNN) training on HPC systems. This included innovations like hybrid five-dimensional parallelism, sub-graph parallelism for transformer models, and memory-aware model parallelism. Some of my work has been published in leading conferences such as ISC, IPDPS, and SC. I was honored to receive the Graduate Research Award from the CSE Department in recognition of my academic excellence.

My research sits at the intersection of Deep Learning and High-Performance Computing. I actively contribute to distributed training frameworks like LBANN and explore parallelization strategies for DNNs, integrating these with communication middleware like MVAPICH2. During my time at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I worked with the LBANN group, implementing sub-graph and sub-grid parallelism techniques that outperformed traditional data-parallel methods.

Over the years, I have developed expertise across a wide range of machine learning applications, including speech analysis, time series modeling, hyperparameter optimization, and computer vision. Early in my career, I worked as a trainee and associate at organizations like Speech Markers, Busigence, and ABV-IIITMâ€™s Sponsored Research Cell, where I built and refined machine learning models for speech recognition, health diagnostics, and traffic sign detection.

I am also an active contributor to the research community. I have served as a reviewer for top conferences and journals such as IPDPS, ICS, TPDS, and Hot Interconnects. Iâ€™ve been invited to deliver tutorials on high-performance machine learning at premier conferences including SuperComputing, ISCA, PPoPP, and ASPLOS, helping train professionals and academics in scalable AI.

Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring. At The Ohio State University, I served as an instructor and lab assistant for graduate-level HPC and AI courses, while mentoring numerous Ph.D., graduate, and undergraduate students. I also organize and volunteer at leading events such as SuperComputing and the MVAPICH Users Group.
