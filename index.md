Dr. Arpan Jain is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft, where he contributes to the AI Frameworks (AIFx) team within CoreAI. His work is centered around enhancing the performance and efficiency of deep learning inference, particularly for Large Language Models (LLMs). Prior to this role, he worked as an Applied Scientist at Bing Ads, where he explored deep learning model optimization and novel architectures like AMD GPUs, and presented his research at NVIDIA GTC 2024.

Dr. Jain received his Ph.D. in High Performance Computing and Deep Learning from The Ohio State University, under the mentorship of Prof. D. K. Panda. His doctoral work focused on novel parallelization strategies for large-scale Deep Neural Network (DNN) training on HPC systems. His contributions include hybrid five-dimensional parallelism, sub-graph parallelism for transformer models, and memory-aware model parallelism‚Äîsome of which are published in leading venues such as ISC, IPDPS, and SC. He was honored with the Graduate Research Award by the CSE Department for his academic excellence.

Dr. Jain's research lies at the intersection of Deep Learning and High-Performance Computing. He actively contributes to distributed training frameworks like LBANN, explores parallelization strategies for DNNs, and integrates such methods with communication middleware like MVAPICH2. During his time at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he contributed to the LBANN group by implementing sub-graph and sub-grid parallelism techniques that outperformed traditional data-parallel methods.

Throughout his career, Dr. Jain has developed expertise across a broad spectrum of machine learning applications including speech analysis, time series modeling, hyperparameter optimization, and computer vision. His earlier roles as a trainee and associate at organizations like Speech Markers, Busigence, and ABV-IIITM‚Äôs Sponsored Research Cell allowed him to build and refine machine learning models for speech recognition, health diagnostics, and traffic sign detection.

Dr. Jain is also an active contributor to the research community. He has served as a reviewer for top conferences and journals like IPDPS, ICS, TPDS, and Hot Interconnects. His invited tutorials on high-performance machine learning have been featured at premier conferences including SuperComputing, ISCA, PPoPP, and ASPLOS, helping train professionals and academics in scalable AI.

In addition to research, Dr. Jain is passionate about teaching and mentoring. At The Ohio State University, he served as an instructor and lab assistant for graduate-level HPC and AI courses, while mentoring numerous Ph.D., graduate, and undergraduate students. His mentorship has extended into organizing and volunteering at leading events like SuperComputing and the MVAPICH Users Group.
